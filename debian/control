Description: 
 pathmonitor This is a purely educational attempt to practice Go skills. I
 needed a daemon that will monitor some directories in my filesystem and
 run a command if a new file is detected in monitored locations.
 .
 I am aware that it is also possible to implement this with Python, a
 bash script or in a hundred different technologies, but my primary goal
 was to practice my newly obtained Go skills to do something practical
 for my own use.  Usage Eventually the daemon will be controlled by a
 systemd service and a config file under /etc/pathmonitor.yaml. Example
 unit file and config file are in the source code.
